# Explore Knowledge Flow

This repository accompanies the opening keynote of Explore DDD 2025. The talk wasn't recorded but I will share a summary, so you can get the gist. 

You are welcome to submit a PR to recommend changes and improvements. I will attribute accepted changes here in the README. 

It takes a community to design a system!
